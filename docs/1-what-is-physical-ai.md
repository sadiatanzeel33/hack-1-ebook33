# Chapter 1: What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the integration of AI systems with physical bodies or environments, allowing them to interact with the real world. Unlike purely software-based AI, which operates in digital domains, Physical AI involves agents (such as robots, drones, or autonomous vehicles) that can perceive, reason, and act within physical spaces.

This field combines principles from robotics, control theory, machine learning, and cognitive science to create intelligent systems capable of performing tasks in unstructured and dynamic physical settings. Key aspects include:

*   **Perception:** Using sensors (cameras, lidar, touch sensors) to gather information about the physical environment.
*   **Cognition/Reasoning:** Processing sensory data, understanding the state of the world, making decisions, and planning actions.
*   **Action/Control:** Executing planned actions through actuators (motors, grippers) and controlling physical movements.
*   **Interaction:** Engaging with humans, other robots, and objects in the physical world.

The goal of Physical AI is to develop robust, adaptable, and safe intelligent systems that can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously, bringing AI capabilities into tangible applications like manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and service industries.
