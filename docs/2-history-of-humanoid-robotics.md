# Chapter 2: History of Humanoid Robotics

The concept of humanoid robots has fascinated humanity for centuries, appearing in myths, legends, and early mechanical automatons. However, the practical realization of humanoid robotics is a relatively modern endeavor, driven by advancements in engineering, computation, and artificial intelligence.

**Early Automatons and Concepts:**
*   **Ancient Civilizations:** Descriptions of animated statues and mechanical servants exist in ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Chinese texts.
*   **13th-18th Centuries:** European craftsmen created intricate automatons, such as Jaques de Vaucanson's flutist and duck, which mimicked human or animal actions but lacked true intelligence.

**20th Century: Emergence of Modern Robotics:**
*   **1920s:** The term "robot" was coined by Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. The first electrically powered robot, "Eric," was built in 1928.
*   **1960s:** Industrial robots began to emerge, focused on repetitive tasks in manufacturing. Unimate, the first industrial robot, was introduced.
*   **1970s-1980s:** Research into bipedal locomotion and human-like manipulation gained traction. Waseda University in Japan was a pioneer, developing robots like WABOT-1, which could walk and communicate.
*   **1990s:** Honda began its ambitious humanoid robot project, culminating in the development of P2 and later the renowned ASIMO, showcasing advanced bipedal walking and human interaction capabilities.

**21st Century: Advanced Humanoids and AI Integration:**
*   **2000s onwards:** Continued advancements in sensor technology, artificial intelligence, and lightweight materials led to more agile and sophisticated humanoids. Robots like HRP-2, QRIO, and eventually Boston Dynamics' Atlas pushed boundaries in dynamic movement and perception.
*   **Present Day:** Humanoid robots are increasingly being developed for a wider range of applications, including disaster response, healthcare, entertainment, and personal assistance, often integrating advanced AI for learning, decision-making, and natural human-robot interaction. The focus has shifted from mere imitation to functional intelligence and adaptability in complex environments.
